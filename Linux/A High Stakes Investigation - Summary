According to the evidence that has been gathered, it is safe to assume that the casino patreon, 
Mylie Schmidt and the roulette dealer Billy Jones are working together to pull off this Lucky Duck scam. 
After analyzing the data from the roulette losses on March 10th, 12th and 15th, 
Mylie Schmidt was present all three days and played at the roulette table multiple times throughout the day. 
Those times are 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm. The roulette dealer that uncoincidentally worked at the table during those times, on those 3 days was Billy Jones. 
All the dealers and players were paired randomly on those days and times, except for these two.
