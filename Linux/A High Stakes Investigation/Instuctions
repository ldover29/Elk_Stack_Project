You have just been hired by Lucky Duck Casino as a security analyst.

Lucky Duck has lost a significant amount of money on the roulette tables over the last month.

The largest losses occurred on March 10, 12, and 15.

Your manager believes there is a player working with a Lucky Duck dealer to steal money at the roulette tables.

The casino has a large database with data on wins and losses, player analysis, and dealer schedules.

You are tasked with navigating, modifying, and analyzing these data files to gather evidence on the rogue player and dealer.

You will prepare several evidence files to assist the prosecution.

You must work quickly as Lucky Duck can't afford any more losses.


Goal:

With the logs provided, uncover the identities of the rogue casino player and dealer colluding to scam Lucky Duck out of thousands of dollars.

After your investigation, you will provide a summary of your findings to the casino.
